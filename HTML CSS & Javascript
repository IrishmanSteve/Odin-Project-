Relative links are when something links to another page on the same website. To do this, the files should be saved in the same folder.
It does not include the domain name as it assumes it will be the same.
Relative links only include the file path to the other page RELATIVE to the page you are creating the link on.
Below is an example of a relative link with 'pages/' as it is in a file called 'pages'
<a href="pages/about.html">About</a>
If it wasn't in a separate file, it would simply be 'about.html'

Prepending ./ before the link will prevent some issues. 
By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start looking for the file/directory RELATIVE to the CURRENT directory.
