Git allows you to view every change in your work when you saved it, compared to a text editor which only ever saves over what you had. 
A save in Git records differences in the files and folders AND keeps a historical record of each save.

As an individual developer, Git enables you to review how your project grows and to easily look at or restore file states from the past. 
Once connected to a network, Git allows you to push your project to GitHub or other alternatives such as: 

- Bitbucket
- Beanstalk
- GitLab 

for sharing and collaborating with other developers.
